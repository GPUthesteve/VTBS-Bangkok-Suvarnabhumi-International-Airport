# VTBS-Bangkok-Suvarnabhumi-International-Airport
a place to provide afcad update for ppl who wants this airport updated

lets go long.. starting with some infos of the airport...lol

Suvarnabhumi Airport (Thai: ท่าอากาศยานสุวรรณภูมิ, RTGS: Tha-akatsayan Suwannaphum, from Sanskrit सुवर्णभूमि (Suvarṇabhūmi), literally 'golden land') (IATA: BKK, ICAO: VTBS), also known unofficially as Bangkok Airport,[4][5] is one of two international airports serving the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, the other one being Don Mueang International Airport (DMK), which remains open as a low-cost carriers hub.[6][7] Suvarnabhumi Airport covers an area of 3,240 ha (32.4 km2; 8,000 acres), making it one of the biggest international airports in Southeast Asia and a regional hub for aviation. The airport is also a major Cargo Air Freight Hub (20th busiest in 2019), which has a designated Airport Free Zone, as well as road links to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) on Motorway 7.[8] (Src. wikipedia)

now to my project...
Well, As I see A_A Released VTBS as a payware, i felt nothing but sad for simmers who just want to "go there", needs no buildin but just an accurate airport that is accurate in positioning and layout. so i built this afcad so u guys can just land there, taxi to ze stand without scratching your head like "where tf is my gate", how i can do this approach.

I've seen Ray Smith's work in avsim/flightsim including VTBS but it bugs for...me : where is ze taxiway pavement? stands are kinda meh and, importantly, SAT terminal aera was just build irl but its not there on the sim.
 
So, I decided to make my own AFCAD from scratch....since in p3dv4&below, VTBS isn't inluded airport out-of-the-box 
(fsx was created in 2005 and release on October 13, 2006. the airport, VTBS, was finished and opened for (Regl.) service on September 15, 2006...wait....you'd say the airport finished before the release of the sim, why isnt it default....well, idk but they dont even update for the airport presence on SP1 and 2, i'd say a lot is missing and not corrected, not only this place. and continues "that" missing things till P3Dv5 when they add it as a default airport...which is..just flyable but still missing SAT Terminal) 

I did position every stands using data from charts provided by eAIP thailand (google it for more info). ground details are from sattelite. (but i dont include photoreal as i see it's not needed, just and afcad and here you go.)
You can use default GPS to fly in here, i've included the approach route into the gps system so u guys can program it and fly in...just like irl(and pls read ze charts)
speaking of the technical things, I make this airport using ADE v1.79 Dev build.


for more realism, after reading charts and you feel like how can I do STAR and there's radar vector without waypoints on default GPS, these are tools that can help you.
Navaids : https://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html (now they include waypoints in the pack unlike old days where i need to download seperate waypoint/fix update on that site)
GPS2020 : https://library.avsim.net/search.php?SearchTerm=gps2020&CatID=root&Go=Search dump your old fs9gps with this. you can insert/delete waypoints on the fly without modding the plan.
		  also, it's very helpful when ATCs ask you to proceed direct some waypoint on the route and default DTO function breaks the flightplan. 
		  
		  
Create using Airport Design Editor V1.79, FSX native. 

oh, and this thing is pure AFCAD file, no custom, facinating model building used. if u want, buy actual one from "Mo Tik" AA_Sceneries. i make this just for "free" simmers outta there.
